# Computer-Networks-Error-Detection
This repository contains a Python implementation of a sender-receiver program that transfers data frames and checks for errors using checksum and CRC techniques. It includes various error injection methods, such as single-bit errors, isolated errors, odd-number errors, and burst errors, to simulate real-world scenarios in data transmission.
